Palangi Rahul,4,Worth the money,"//  What I Like Most? //1) Double door fridge with a convenient button control panel and with a 3 star energy efficient rating is an amazing deal. Nearly consumes 195 units per year, very economical.2) Cooling is very good, you need to set freezer temperature at optimal settings for ice making. Within 1.5hrs it is making ice, which is good. For the fridge 1 to 7°c has been given at the outdoor, 3°c is enough throughout the year, at summer peak times you need to set it at 1 or 2°c.3) Power ..."

Vaishnavi V,4,Value-for-money,"Im posting this after 1 week of usePros-1.Design and vibrant looks2. Digital display3. LED light 4. Rapid cooling technology5.Food or liquids cool very rapidly and freezer is too good and its cooling capacity is just awesomeCons-1.No light in freezer section2.

If nothing in freezer section, we cannot get the temperature controlled even i..."
Flipkart Customer,1,Useless product,Installation not done for 10 days.. Pathetic after sales service. A customer service executive will keep you on hold and will not give any resolution to your query.Strongly suggest to avoid buying any product on filpkart.

Tejveer  singh,1,Very poor,"Delivery is on time but installation process is worthles. After committing one day i am waiting from last 15 days but not received any call till now, very disappointing. Not happy with this"
venkateswara reddy D,3,Just okay,"Main thing is space management, Samsung managed but not done smartly , LG is best in space management , we can not put 2.25 drink bottle vertically in fridge, even single door fridge can , we can not put medium sized utensils with out removing one rack , performance is ok , Design is good , not so practical"
